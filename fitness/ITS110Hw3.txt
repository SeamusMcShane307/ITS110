1.) CSS stands for cascading style sheet and is a file that can be linked to other files in order to format their appearance.

2.) An External style sheet is formatting that is contained outside of the file that it is altering.
    An Internal style sheet is the inverse of the external in the sense that it is a self contained method of styling the file within which it resides.
    The benefit of having an external style sheet is that it can be linked to multiple other files so that they all have a fairly uniform look.
    While that is a great benefit when making a website that has an array of web pages it can cause them to lack individuality/ something that might look
    nice on one of the linked webpage might not on another. The benefit to internal is that you can customize an individual page with affecting 
    other web pages allowing for extremely unique page with no conflicts in styles, the downside is that it would take a long time and would need
    to be typed out for every one of those individual pages.

3.) A responsive design means that the webpage will change its aspects to accommodate the device that it is being loaded on.
    Fluid layout allows the webpage to stretch and shrink in order to fit an appropriate amount of its aspects on screen.
    Media queries allow the program to understand the size of the screen and then apply styles based on that size.
    Flexible images means that images will stretch and shrink based on the proportions of the webpage.

4.) Some of the best key practices for designing mobile viewports are the methods listed in the question above. 
    Fluid layout, media queries, and flexible images are extremely important when creating a mobile viewport because no matter how good the 
    contents of the webpage are, if they are not displayed properly it doesn't do them justice. So when it comes to importance I would
    say laying the groundwork for an appealing website takes the highest precedence.
